## Design Patterns

In software engineering, we as developers tend to encounter a lot of the same problems throughout our careers. Regardless of where we are, what we're working on or the problem we're trying to solve these issues continue to show up. They're common, reoccuring problems, and are exactly what design patterns are trying to solve. In 1977, Alexander [@alexanderPatternLanguageTowns1977], wrote a book on design patterns called "A Pattern Language". In this book, design patterns are defined as reocurring problem for which we have a common, repeatable solution that can be implemented numerous times over without ever being exactly the same. Funny enough, this book is actually about architecture in buildings and towns and not programming. This isn't the only benefit that design patterns provide however. They also give us a taxonomy in which to discuss said issues.

In 1987, following the work of Alexander, Beck et al, began working with design patterns in programming [citation]. In 1994, "Design Patterns: Elements of Reuseable Object-Oriented Software" was published by a group known as the "Gang of Four". In this book, Gamma et al. [@gammaDesignPatternsAbstraction2002] describe four essential elements of a design patterns: pattern name, problem, solution, and consequnces. The pattern name is used to describe the problem, solution, and consequnces of the design problem. The problem element tells us when its appropriate to apply the pattern. The solution element describes the design, relationships, responsibilites, and collaborations used in the pattern. Finally, consequences describe the trade-offs invovled with using the pattern.

Based on the work by Gamma et al, design patterns can be seperated into three distinct categories: creational, structural, and behavioral. 

- **Creational design patterns -** allow for a more flexible and loosely coupled architecture by abstracting out the process of object instantiation to another part of the system. Essentially, creational patterns are a way of achieving inversion of control in a system. Examples of the creational pattern would be: abstract factory, builder, prototype, and singleton pattern.
- **Structural design patterns -** are concerned with how classes and objects are composed together to create new, larger ones while still being flexible and efficient in their designs. The idea behind these patterns is based on inheritance. Examples include: composite, decorator, flyweight, and the adapter pattern.
- **Behavioral design patterns -** like structural design patterns, behavioral patterns also use the idea of inheritance to distribute behavior between classes. Essentially, behavioral patterns modify the behavior of classes and thus change the way that classes interact with one another. Examples include: observer, and iterator design patterns.
