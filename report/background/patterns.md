## Design Patterns

In software engineering we as developers tend to encounter a lot of the same problems regardless of the actual work we do. In fact, most of the problems we as developers solve are not brand new. These common, reocurring problems are the reason that design patterns exist. Design patterns give us a repeatable solution that we can use to solve these problems. However, design patterns are not actual, concrete solutions to these problems, but rather they give us a template that we can work from in order to solve the problem. These templates allow us to incorporate best practices into our code while allowing us to focus on what really matters.

Design patterns first appeared around 1977 as an architectural concept discovered by Christopher Alexander [citation]. Close to a decade later, Beck et al began experimenting with the use of design patterns in programming. Not to long after the work done by Alexander and Beck et al. a book on design patterns was released. The book, "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" was published in 1994 by a group of software engineers known as the "Gang of Four" [citation - gamma, erich et al].
