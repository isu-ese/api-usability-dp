## Usability
Usability is a quality attribute that can be verified or measured in a software product. Usability is defined in numerous classifications including ISO 9126, ISO 9241-11, and ISO/TR 16982:2002 [Analyzing the impact of usability on software design]. Usability as defined by ISO 9126 is "A set of attributes that bear on the effort needed for use, and on the individual assesment of such use, by a stated or implied set of users." [citation placeholder]. ISO 9241-11 goes on to define usability as "The extent to which a system, product, or service can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use." [citation placeholder].

### Usability Inspection Methods

Usability inspection is a set of methods where an evaluator, usually an expert in the field, is brought in to inspect a user interface (UI) with the goal of identifying design issues as well as the associated severity of each issue. There are numerous inspection methods used in evaluating usability [@mackUsabilityInspectionMethods1994]:

1. Heuristic evaluation is a method for finding usability problems where a small set of evaluaters, usually one at a time, judge the UI based on its compliance with a set of predetermined usability principles known as heuristics [@nielsenHeuristicEvaluationUser1990][@mackUsabilityInspectionMethods1994].
