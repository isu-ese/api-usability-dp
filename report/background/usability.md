## Usability

Usability is a quality attribute that is used to assess the level of difficulty associated with using a system [@juristoAnalysingImpactUsability2007]. Low usability is a good indicator of a system that is difficult to use and is also likely to be rejeted by users. Usability has been defined in multiple standards including ISO 9126, ISO 9241-11, ISO/TR 16982:2202, and ISO 25010:2011. In this paper, when we refer to usability we will be using the definition provided in ISO 25010:2011. ISO 25010:2-11 defines usabilty as "". Usability is not a single measure of a system, but rather, is made up of five subcharacteristics: learnability, usability, memorability, errors, and satisfaction [citation]. These subcharacteristics will be discussed in more detail in section 2.3.1.

For a long time, usability was thought to only apply to the user interface of a system and was something that could simply be added at any point in the development lifecycle. Teams would desgin these systems and then expect to hand them to a usability team where they were then expected to make the product useable [@ferreUsabilityBasicsSoftware2001]. It wasn't until recently that businesses began to undersand the importance of usability and actually began to take it seriously.  Usability is something that needs to be considered at every stage of the development process. Since usability is concerned with the interactions between a system and its users it makes sense that it would play an important role at every step in the process. According to a study by donahue [@donahueUsabilityBottomLine2001], it was found that for every dollar invested in usability you can expect a return of $30.25. 

### Usability Quality Components

Nielsen defined five quality components that make up usability. According to Nielsen, usability is a quality attribute that assesses how difficult a user interface (UI) is to use. [also defined in ISO 25010:2011] - Section is still a work in progress.

- **Learnability -** Deals with the level of difficulty a user will experience when first interacting with a system to accomplish basic tasks. 
- **Efficiency -** Looks at how long it takes a user to complete a certain task once they've gained familiarity with the system.
- **Memorability -** Focuses on a users ability to return to a system after a period of time and regain efficiency using it.
- **Errors -** Looks at the frequency, severity, and recoverability of errors users make while interacting with the system. 
- **Satisfaction -** Deals with the amount of fulfillment a user gets from using the system.

### Usability Inspection

According to Nielsen et al, usablity inspection is a set of methods where evaluators inspect a user interface (UI) to identify usability issues, severeity of issues, and the overall usability of a design. There are four basic types of usability inspection methods: automatic, empiracally, formal, and informal. Automatic usability inspection is accomplished by running a UIs specifications through a computer program. Empiracal usability inspection invovles using actual users to test the UI. Formal usability inspection is done using models and formulas to calculate a usability score. Finally, informal usability inspection is based on general guidelines and principals as well as the skill and experience of the evaluators testing the UI [@mackUsabilityInspectionMethods1994]. Next, will take a look at the actual methods involved in usability inspection.

- **Heuristic evaluation -** is an informal usability inspection method where evaluators, usability experts, independently judge a UI based on its compliance with a set of usability principles known as heuristics. This method relies solely on the skills and experience of the evaluators to find potential issues in the design.
- **Cognitive walkthroughs -** is an formal usability inspection method where evaluators, usually the developers and designers of the software, take turns role playing as users of the software to perform specific tasks while the other members evaluate and document the process for later refinement.
- **Formal usability inspections -** is a formal usability inspection method and is a combination of heuristic evaluation and the cognitive walkthough methods. It is a six step process that involves: assembling a team, assigning roles to each member, distributing appropriate documentation (design, technical, etc), giving out instructions on what is to be done, independent evaluation of the software, and finally, a discussion of issues and concerns that were identified during the process.
- **Pluralistic walkthroughs -** is an informal usability evaluation where a group of individuals, users, developers and designers, and usability experts walk through a scenario together and discuss any issues or concerns they might have. 
- **Feature inspections -** is an formal usability inspection method where a set of features used to accomplish a specific task are evaluated based on the given user story.
- **Consistency inspections -** is an informal usability inpsection method where designers from multiple projects inspect an interface based on how similiar it is to their own projects.
- **Standards inspections -** is an informal usability inspection method involving usability experts with knowledge of interface standards use their skills and experience to evaluate a UI based on its compliance with said standards.

### Usability Testing Methods

Usability testing is used to determine the level of difficulty associated with using a system. Numerous usability testing methods exist, however, we will only be going over the most commonly used methods in this paper. However, very little research into usability testing exists this section merely aims to provide an overview of the field.

- **Hallway testing -** is a usability testing method where randomly selected individuals, people passing by in the hallway, are brought in to test the usability of a system.
- **Remote usability testing -** is broken down into two categories: synchronous, and asynchronous usability testing. Synchrounous usability testing employs software such as skype, discord, or any other software that allows a user to be observed while using a system from anywhere in the world. Asynchrounous usability testing is where a users actions are automatically tracked and logged by the system. Things like how long a user was on the page, what and where they clicked on the screen, how often they visited a certain page, the previous page that was used to get to the current one, and so-on.
- **Expert review -** involves the use of usability experts who are brought in to judge a system based on their skills and knowledge of the field.
- **Automated expert review -** similiar to expert reviews, however, the testing is done via a program that has been encoded with an experts knowledge in the form of a set of rules that are used to evaluate the usability of a system.
- **A/B Testing -** also known as split testing, is where we have two identical versions of a system, usually a web site, where one version contains a slight modification with the intent of studying whether this variation will impact a users behavior.
- **Think aloud Protocol -** is a process where a user or group of users are brought in to use a system and during that time are instructed to share their thought process out loud while doing so.
