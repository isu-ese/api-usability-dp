## Usability

Usability is a quality attribute that is used to assess the level of difficulty associated with using a product [@juristoAnalysingImpactUsability2007]. When it comes to usability we first have to understand that it isn't just one aspect of a system or even a particular characteristic of a system. It is a collection of sub-characteristics that actually make up usability. These sub-characteristics will be discussed in more detail in section 2.3.1. Usability has multiple defintions and depending on where you look, who you ask, and the context in which it is used will determine which answer you get. For example, if we look at the International Organization for Standardization, we can see that there are numerous standardizations that deal with usability: ISO 9126, ISO 9241-11, and ISO/TR 16982:2202. 


ISO 9126 defines usability as "A set of attributes that bear on the effort needed for use, and on the individual assesment of such use, by a stated or implied set of users." [ISO 9126]. ISO 9241-11 and ISO/TR 16982:2002 define usability as the "extent to which a system, product, or service can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfation in a specified context of use." [ISO 9241-11; ISO/TR 16982:2002]. 

### Usability Quality Components

Jakob Nielsen a danish web consultant who possesses a Ph.D. in human-computer interaction (HCI) from the Technical University of Denmark defined five quality components that make up usability. According to Nielsen, usability is a quality attribute that assesses how difficult a user interface (UI) is to use.

- **Learnability -** Deals with the level of difficulty a user will experience when first interacting with a system to accomplish basic tasks. 
- **Efficiency -** Looks at how long it takes a user to complete a certain task once they've gained familiarity with the system.
- **Memorability -** Focuses on a users ability to return to a system after a period of time and regain efficiency using it.
- **Errors -** Looks at the frequency, severity, and recoverability of errors users make while interacting with the system. 
- **Satisfaction -** Deals with the amount of fulfillment a user gets from using the system.

### Usability Inspection Methods

Usability inspection is a set of methods where an evaluator, usually an expert in the field, is brought in to inspect a user interface (UI) with the goal of identifying design issues as well as the associated severity of each issue. There are numerous inspection methods used in evaluating usability [@mackUsabilityInspectionMethods1994]:

- **Heuristic evaluation -** is a method for finding usability problems where a small set of evaluaters, usually one at a time, judge the UI based on its compliance with a set of predetermined usability principles known as heuristics [@nielsenHeuristicEvaluationUser1990; @mackUsabilityInspectionMethods1994].
- **Cognitive walkthroughs - **
- **Formal usability inspections - **
- **Pluralistic walkthroughs -**
- **Feature inspections - **
- **Consistency inspections - **
- **Standards inspections - **
