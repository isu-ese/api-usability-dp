## Usability
Usability is a quality attribute that can be verified or measured in a software product. Usability is defined in numerous classifications including ISO 9126, ISO 9241-11, and ISO/TR 16982:2002 [@juristoAnalysingImpactUsability2007]. Usability as defined by ISO 9126 is "A set of attributes that bear on the effort needed for use, and on the individual assesment of such use, by a stated or implied set of users." [PlaceHolder]. ISO 9241-11 goes on to define usability as "The extent to which a system, product, or service can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use." [PlaceHolder].

### Usability Quality Components

Jakob Nielsen a danish web consultant who posses a Ph.D. in human-computer interaction (HCI) from the Technical University of Denmark defined five quality components that make up usability. According to Nielsen, usability is a quality attribute that assesses how difficult a user interface (UI) is to use.

- **Learnability -** Deals with the level of difficulty a user will experience when first interacting with a system to accomplish basic tasks. 
- **Efficiency -** Looks at how long it takes a user to complete a certain task once they've gained familiarity with the system.
- **Memorability -** Focuses on a users ability to return to a system after a period of time and regain efficiency using it.
- **Errors -** Looks at the frequency, severity, and recoverability of errors users make while interacting with the system. 
- **Satisfaction -** Deals with the amount of fulfillment a user gets from using the system.

### Usability Inspection Methods

Usability inspection is a set of methods where an evaluator, usually an expert in the field, is brought in to inspect a user interface (UI) with the goal of identifying design issues as well as the associated severity of each issue. There are numerous inspection methods used in evaluating usability [@mackUsabilityInspectionMethods1994]:

- **Heuristic evaluation -** is a method for finding usability problems where a small set of evaluaters, usually one at a time, judge the UI based on its compliance with a set of predetermined usability principles known as heuristics [@nielsenHeuristicEvaluationUser1990; @mackUsabilityInspectionMethods1994].
- **Cognitive walkthroughs - **
- **Formal usability inspections - **
- **Pluralistic walkthroughs -**
- **Feature inspections - **
- **Consistency inspections - **
- **Standards inspections - **
