## Internal Validity

Internal validity deals with the degree to which a study is able to rule out alternative explanations in order to show that the evidence presented throughout the paper is adequate in proving that a causal relationship exists between two variables. Therefore, since this study makes no such argument, there are no internal threats to validity.
