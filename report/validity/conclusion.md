## Conclusion Validity

Conclusion validity is concerned with whether the operations of a study are able to be replicated with the same results. Therefore, since an SMS aims to provide a broad overview of a specific field through the collection of previous primary studies we do have threats to conclusion validity.

- **Search Terms -** the search string used in the paper may not contain all appropriate keywords, synonyms, or alternate keywords that would otherwise ensure all appropriate papers could be located. However, in an attempt to minimize this issue we included all synonyms and alternate keywords that are in common use when discussing usability and reliability as defined in ISO 25010:2011 which is the standard that deals with these ideas.
- **Search Methods -** the search methods used in this paper to locate relevant papers could possibly lead to missing relevant papers due to the fact that only online databases were queried.
- **Limited Access -** since we were unable to query every relevant database or search engine in finding appropriate studies it's possible that not every relevant paper was identified.
