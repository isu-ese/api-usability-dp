## Data Sources

The data sources used in this paper included: IEEEXplore, ACM Digital Library, SpringerLink, Web of Science, and the Science Direct database. The search results were as followed: IEEEXplore returned 1410 results, ACM Digital Library returned 886 results, SpringLink returned 4619 results, Web of Science returned 2314 results, and Science direct returned 8219 results. All search results were also limited to the years between 2009-2019.

We choose to use the ACM Digital Library along with IEEEXplore for their large academic databases that largely focus on computer science as well as the fact that together they cover articles, books, conference papers, technical standards, and journal papers. We also decided to go with SpringerLink, Web of Science, and Science Direct because of there wide coverage of software engineering journals as well as the fact that using multiple databases helps to eliminate bias in our results.
