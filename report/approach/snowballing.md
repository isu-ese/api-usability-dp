## Snowballing Approach

The snowballing process used in this paper was described by Wohlin [@wohlinGuidelinesSnowballingSystematic2014] and defines two types of snowballing procedures: forward and backward snowballing. The first step in the snowballing process is to obtain the initial set of papers, known as the starting set, that will be used to begin the snowballing process.

Backwards snowballing is an iterative process where the references for each paper in the set are used to identify new papers that might have been missed during the initial gathering. Each paper is then ran through the same exclusion and inclusion criteria as the initial starting set to determine its eligibility. This process is then repeated for each reference until all references have been exhausted for each paper.

Forward snowballing, like backward snowballing, is an iterative process where new papers are identified by searching for papers that reference the ones already being examined. These papers are then ran through the same inclusion and exclusion criteria to determine their eligibility. Usually, forward and backward snowballing involve reading only the title or abstract to determine a papers eligibility, however, is both of these should prove inadequate the entire paper is then read.

Throughout the process there may false positives (papers were included that shouldn't have been) that require all papers identified from this one to be removed and the snowballing process to start over. It's important to note that only the papers identified from the current one being examined are to be removed.

Once all of the papers in the start set have been examined the process is repeated for each new paper that identified from the previous round of snowballing. This process will continue until no new papers are identified. It is at this point that Wohlin recommends contacting the authors for each paper that was included to ensure that no other papers exist. If still no new papers are identified at this point the snowballing process is complete.
