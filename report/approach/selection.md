## Paper Selection

The first step in our selection process was to manually search through the electronic databases listed in sections 3.2. After this initial search we had gathered x papers for possible inclusion or exclusion. The next step in our process was to manually read through each papers title, abstract, and keywords in order to determine a papers eligibility. If more information was still needed after this to determine a papers eligibility the full paper was read. After determining a papers eligibility we used the snowballing process listed in section 3.8 to discover additional papers that might have been missed earlier in our process. After identifying any missed papers, we then repeated the above process to determine their eligibility.

Of the x papers that were initially included, only y were actually included after running them through the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of the y papers that were eligible for inclusion we identified z additional papers after performing our snowballing approach. Of the additional z papers that were found only w papers were further included.
