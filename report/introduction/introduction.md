# Introduction

In software engineering, quality attributes such as usability and reliability are used as measures of software quality. In total, there are six main software quality attributes listed in the software quality model written by the International Organization for Standardization located in ISO 9126-1 [citation]. Usability deals with the level of difficulty users experience when using a product. Low usability is a good indicator that a product is difficult to use and is likely to be rejected by users. ISO 9126-1 defines usability as "A set of attributes that bear on the effort needed for use, and on the individual assesment of such use, by a stated or implied set of users." [citation]. This tells us that usability has it's own set of attributes, subcharacteristics, that determine the usability of a product. ISO 9126-1 defines these subcharacteristics as: understandability, learnability, operability, attractiveness, and usability complicance. However, throughout this paper we will be using Jakob Nielsens definition of usability which is: learnability, efficiency, memorability, erros, and satisfaction. More information on usability can be found in section [section #]. [Add information on donahue usability and the bottom line].

Reliability as defined by ISO 9126-1 is "A set of attributes that beat on the capability of software to maintain its level of performance under stated conditions for a stated period of time." [citation]. Like usability, reliability can also be broken down into subcharactertistics: maturity, fault tolerance, recoverability, and reliability compliance.
